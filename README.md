# C++ - Module 02
## Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form
### Summary:
This document contains the exercises of Module 02 from C++ modules.

### Introduction
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia).
The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!
